                <h3>Nathan Chang | NYU | Computer Science | Spring 2022</h3>
                <p>Computers and technology have been an integral part of my life ever since I was young, and from a young age, I played a lot of video games. As I grew up, my love for video games lead me to a desire to make my own games, and as a natural progression, to programming. Since then, I have taught myself a number of programming languages, and learned even more throughout my educational career, and my desire to make video games developed into a passion for programming and problem solving. Nowadays, I still enjoy playing games with friends, and have developed a passion for cooking, and especially eating, good food.</p>
